    <h1><i>Physical Science Unit 6: Forces</i></h1>
  </div>
  <div class="Forces">
    <ul>
      <h3>A force is:</h3>
      <h2>A push or a pull one object exerts on another
        object</h2>
      <li>Measurements: Pounds(English, lb) and Newtons(Metric, N) </li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div class="forcesTypes">
    <ul>
      <h3>The 6 types of forces:</h3>
      <br>
      <li><b>Normal Force:</b> The force an object exerts to prevent other
        objects from passing through it</li>
        <br>
      <li><b>Friction Force:</b> The resitance against two objects moving past each other</li>
        <br>
      <li><b>Gravity/Weight:</b> The force of attraction between two objects</li>
        <br>
      <li><b>Tension:</b> A force exerited by a rope, cable or sting or anything rope-like</li>
        <br>
      <li><b>Applied Force:</b> A force applied by a person or another object</li>
        <br>
      <li><b>Air Resistance: </b>The frictional force exterted on anything moving
        through a fluid</li>
    </ul>

  </div>
  <div class="netForce">
    <h3>Net Force</h3>
    <p><b>The net force of an object is the result of adding up all of the forces
      acting on said object</b></p>
  </div>
  <div class="1stlaw">
    <h3>Newton's 1st law</h3>
    <ul>
          <p><b>Defintion:</b></p>
          <br>
      <li>
          An object will stay in its current state unless
          acted upon by a net force > 0
      </li>
      <br>
      <li>
        If all forces acting on an object are balenced, they will stay in its
          current state
      </li>
      <br>
      <li>
        <b>Inertia:</b> The tendency for objects to resisit chages in motion
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div class="2ndlaw">
    <h3>Newton's 2nd law</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Explains what happens when an object's net forces doesn't equal 0</li>
      <br>
      <li>When an objects net force is greater than 0, the forces are unbalenced</li>
      <br>
      <li>When the forces are unbalenced, the object moves in the direction of the greater
      force</li>
      <br>
      <li>Force can be calculated with the equation Force = (Mass)(Acceleration)</li>
      <br>
      <li>More mass = Lower acceleration, Less mass = Higher acceleration</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div class="3rd law">
    <h3>Newton's 3rd law</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Defintion:</b> Every action has an equal and opposite</li>
      <br>
      <li>Every action also has a reaction pair, this is called an ACTION REACTION PAIR</li>
      <br>
      <li>These action and reaction pair help create motion and all throughout our lives</li>
      <br>
      <li>These pair cause motion and don't cancel becuase these pairs do not work on the same
      object</li>
      <br>
      <li>The action's force is equal and oppiste of the reaction's force, even if
         the mass of action's is larger than the reaction's mass or if the acceleration
         isnt equal</li>
      <br>
      <br>
      <li><b>Hence, the formula, Ma = F = mA</b></li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div class="freeFall">
    <h3>Free Fall, Distance, Time </h3>
    <ul>
      <li>An object in free fall (falling towards earth) will always fall with the
        constatnt acceleration of <b>9.8 m/s/s or g</b> </li>
        <br>
      <li>The distance an object fell can be calculated using the formula <b>d = Â½(gt^2)</b> </li>
      <br>
      <li>The time an object has been falling can be calculated with the formula <b>t= sqroot(2d/g)</b> </li>

    <h3>What We Learned About Forces</h3>
    <br>
    <p>In this unit, we learned many things. We first learned about the types of
      forces (Normal, Weight, Applied, Friction, Air Resistance, and Tension).
      We learned of examples of these forces and how they are used in real life. We also
      learned about net force and how to calculate this. Then we were introsuced to the
      newtons laws of motion and were educated on what each law states (about the 1st, 2nd
      , and 3rd)</p>

    <h3>How physics affects my life</h3>
    <br>
    <p>In my daily life, physics is at work all around me. When I wake up, gravity
      is pulling me towards the ground while the normal force is pushing me up. When I brush
      my teeth, I apply force to my teeth, which is applied force. When I move accros my carpet,
      friction slows me down. Last but not least, when I jump up in the air to say "YA PHYSICS!!"
      Air resitance keeps me up in the air longer.</p>
